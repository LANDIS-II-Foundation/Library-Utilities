# This file has blank lines, comment lines and EOL comments.
# Some of the comment lines, like these first 3 lines, use
# the default comment-line marker "#".

//	These lines use a different comment-line marker, which is
//	the C++/C# comment marker.

Here's an EOL comment with default marker -->  ## (EOL comment)

  These next lines have EOL comments which use		// a EOL comment
  a different marker than the default marker;		/// Another EOL comment
  they use the C++ comment marker.
